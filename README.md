# Predictive_Maintenance
The project on Predictive Maintenance involves several essential stages of data science, such as preprocessing, analysis, statistics, feature selection, and machine learning models, to anticipate the remaining useful life of a machine. Although it may appear to be a binary classification project with the status of the machine as the target variable, it is, in fact, a regression project that requires the creation of a target variable known as RUL or Remaining Useful Life.
